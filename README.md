Statement: My graduation thesis is mainly focused on creating a nuovo 3D mapping system that can be executed in real time without GPGPU acerelation. All the files are my work, except the "slamdunk" (original SLAM for cameara pose tracking). Besides, those CUDA related files are just practice for visulization speedup, which are not used in the demos and left unfinished.
